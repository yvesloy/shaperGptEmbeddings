This is fundamental to ensure fairness, inclusion and accountability across our community.\\nOur Charter includes best practices identified by our members since our community was created in 2011. By joining the Global Shapers Community, all members agree to live up to the principles outlined below. The Global Shapers Community Charter contains:\\nPurpose and Principles\\nMembership Opportunities\\nMembership Criteria\\nMembership Diversity\\nMembership Commitment\\nResponsible Behaviour\\nMembership Cancellation\\nHub Governance\\nHub Partnerships\\nHub Curatorships\\nHub Elections\\nHub Disagreements\\nHub Opening and Closure\\nGlobal Governance\\nAlumni Network\\nPurpose and Principles\\nThe Global Shapers Community is a non-profit organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, which inspires and connects young changemakers around the world.\\n1.1 Global Shapers work together via a decentralized hub model to deliver projects that address the needs of local communities. Our model brings young people together to test new ideas, collaborate, and take joint action in capital cities, rural areas, small islands and beyond.\\n1.2 Global Shapers join an inspiring network of innovators, activists, entrepreneurs and changemakers from around the world. Members are connected globally through technology, training, events and activities to share solutions, grow their skills and extend their impact.\\n1.3 Exposure to the World Economic Forum and its network of partners, inspires Global Shapers and fosters intergenerational action. Global Shapers derive unique benefits from their affiliation with the Forum, including access to global insights, initiatives and interactions.\\nMembership Opportunities\\nBy becoming a member of the Global Shapers Community, young changemakers:\\n2.1 Join a local hub in the area in which they live, as well as a global network of inspiring young leaders. Locally and globally, members build life-long friendships to scale their impact.\\n2.2 Develop practical skills for leading positive social change in communities through unique training, mentorship, coaching and hands-on experiences at the local and global level.\\n2.3 Collaborate with other young people passionate about shaping the future through joint projects and initiatives. Projects benefit local stakeholders and have concrete outcomes.\\n2.4 Apply to virtual experiences and physical events to exchange perspectives with innovative changemakers and members of the World Economic Forum’s network of experts and leaders.\\n2.5 Gain access to the Global Shapers Community’s digital engagement platform, TopLink, which offers spaces for hubs to interact locally as well as opportunities to collaborate globally.\\n2.6 If members relocate to a new geographic area, they may transfer to another hub. Our hub model creates opportunities to connect with local changemakers wherever you are based.\\nTo request a hub transfer, members email globalshapers@weforum.org with the Curators of the outgoing and incoming hubs in copy. Hubs may opt-out of automatic transfers if the number of transfer requests received per year exceeds 25% of their total size. In this case, existing members must reapply to the new hub, following the incoming hub’s established selection process.\\nMembership Criteria\\nGlobal Shapers are selected at the hub level. Members must:\\n3.1 Be between 18 and 27 when joining the hub (via TopLink account creation).\\n3.2 Demonstrate potential to create social change or have a track record of verifiable results.\\n3.3 Be committed to working with Global Shapers locally or globally to implement projects.\\n3.4 Reside in – or otherwise be physically close to – the area in which their hub is based.\\n3.5 Be from all walks of life and uphold the diversity of the geographic area in which the hub is based. This includes (but is not limited to) age, gender, race, colour, religion, disability, sexual orientation, income, education, political beliefs or other differences.\\nHubs or Global Shapers Headquarters may reject applicants, if they do not meet these criteria. Hubs are expected to select members in good faith. If it is discovered that the above criteria have not been upheld at the time of selection, individual memberships may be cancelled retroactively.\\nReturn to Homepage\\nMembership Diversity\\nOur community believes that diversity is a source of strength. All hubs must:\\n4.1 Select members from all walks of life and uphold the diversity of the area in which the hub is based (see Membership Criteria 3.5). Hubs should be informed about local inequalities and aim to include historically marginalized and/or underrepresented groups in their membership.\\n4.2 Have no more than 3 members from the same organization or company. Hub members must represent diverse stakeholder groups, including disciplines, industries and professions.\\n4.3 Have no more than one gender represent more than 60% of the total membership. Hubs aim for equal representation of men and women, and the inclusion of gender-diverse persons.\\n4.4 Not select nor transfer members who are direct family relatives or partners of existing members. Like other professional and volunteer networks, members avoid conflicts of interest.\\n4.5 After 12 months of operation, maintain a minimum of 20 members. This signals a high-performing hub with effective membership to implement robust projects and initiatives.\\n4.6 Not exceed a maximum of 50 members. *If more than 50 members can belong to a hub, a second hub (or several hubs) may be opened in the area based on relevant geographic boundaries. Global Shapers Headquarters has the sole responsibility for opening new hubs.\\nIf hubs cannot uphold these principles, Global Shapers Headquarters and the Head of the Global Shapers Community may pursue hub closure to uphold the standards set out in this Charter.\\nMembership Commitments\\nBy joining the Global Shapers Community, young changemakers agree to:\\n5.1 Uphold the purpose and principles of the community as outlined in this Charter.\\n5.2 Adhere to respectful and responsible behaviour (Section 6 of this Charter).\\n5.3 Volunteer their time, energy and ideas to advance positive and lasting change.\\n5.4 Participate in at least one hub project and/or one hub leadership role per year.\\n5.5 Be present in at least 60% of hub meetings and/or relevant local activities per year.\\n5.6 Transition to Alumni when they meet eligibility criteria (Section 15 of this Charter).\\n5.7 Inform their hub if their status changes.

This extends to all World Economic Forum and Global Shapers Community events, as well as local hub activities. By becoming a Global Shaper, members commit to ensure that our community remains free from unwelcome, intimidating, offensive, or improper conduct. All Global Shapers must uphold our shared values of:\\n6.1 Passion – As Global Shapers, we channel our passion into action. We apply the community’s principles in our work with others and continuously seek to learn and grow.\\n6.2 Integrity – As Global Shapers, we demonstrate integrity by not speaking about others in disparaging ways. We avoid conflicts of interest and we take responsibility for our actions.\\n6.3 Service – As Global Shapers, we practice service by striving to understand the needs of our communities and responsibly collaborating with local stakeholders to co-create solutions.\\n6.4 Cooperation – As Global Shapers, we cooperate by proactively working with others to achieve common goals. We embrace diversity and differing ideas to make informed decisions.\\n6.5 Commitment – As Global Shapers, we are committed to fulfilling our obligations. We strive to do our best and deliver high-quality results. We are action-oriented and impact-driven.\\nThe Global Shapers Community specifically prohibits:\\n6.6 Offensive or abusive actions, including physical violence, stalking, bullying, or belittling, to achieve a specific aim – such as forcing or influencing a hub member to leave the community.\\n6.7 Offensive or abusive comments, including jokes, about age, gender, national origin, race, colour, religion, disability, sexual orientation, income, political beliefs, or other differences.\\n6.8 Unwelcome verbal or physical sexual advances or sexual harassment that have been perceived as improper by the targeted person and/or discouraged by the targeted person.\\n6.9 Conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating environment including, using hierarchical authority, threats, or fear of retaliation against others – explicitly or implicitly.\\n6.10 Spreading malicious rumors or gossip to exclude, isolate members, or for any other reason.\\nAdditionally, all Global Shapers are expected to:\\n6.11 Respect cultures, opinions, lifestyles and thinking that differ from their own.\\n6.12 Refrain from engaging in online bullying or harassment, including making or reposting contentious, libelous, defamatory or derogatory comments or statements on social media. Members act responsibly when using their personal social media accounts and digital tools.\\nIf Responsible Behaviour is not upheld and these principles are violated, individual community memberships may be cancelled by hub Curators, Global Shapers Headquarters or by the Head of the Global Shapers Community.\\nIf a member witnesses improper conduct or is a victim of harassment, Global Shapers can contact Global Shapers Headquarters by email via globalshapers@weforum.org.\\n6.13 Retaliation or bullying of a member who has reported improper conduct or harassment will lead to responsive action, up to and including membership cancellation without notice.\\n6.14 The privacy of all parties involved must be respected.\\nMembership Cancellation\\nIndividual memberships in the Global Shapers Community can either be cancelled at the hub level or by Global Shapers Headquarters directly. The following guidelines apply:\\n7.1 If you cannot uphold the Membership Commitments in Section 5 of this Charter, you can step down by writing to your hub’s Curator. In this case, you can reapply in the future.\\n7.2 If you cannot uphold the Membership Commitments in Section 5 of this Charter but are not willing to step down, it is the responsibility of your hub's Curatorship to inform you of your shortcomings and offer a minimum two months to allow you to fulfill your commitments.\\nIf amends are not made, the Curatorship can cancel your membership. Members must be informed about the decision and their ability to appeal by contacting Global Shapers Headquarters at globalshapers@weforum.org. In this case, individual members cannot reapply.\\n7.3 If Responsible Behaviour is not upheld as per Section 6 of this Charter, hub Curatorships can cancel individual memberships at the local level immediately. The respective member must be informed about the decision and their ability to appeal by contacting the Global Shapers Team at globalshapers@weforum.org. In this case, members cannot reapply.\\n7.4 Individual memberships can be cancelled by Global Shapers Headquarters. If someone does not uphold the principles and behaviours in this Charter, the Head of the Global Shapers Community can cancel individual memberships at their sole discretion. If there is sufficient rationale, a cancellation may be made immediately, without notice, and the outcome final.\\nHub Governance\\nWe believe in the power of teams. Our decentralized hub model brings young people together to collaborate, test new ideas and take joint action. Each hub is organized autonomously and can develop its own local guidelines. If local guidelines conflict, this Charter will prevail. All hubs in the Global Shapers Community:\\n8.1 Offer safe learning spaces for the personal and professional development of hub members. Hubs develop youth leaders through upskilling, peer mentorship and hands-on experiences.\\n8.2 Provide unique networking opportunities for members to build connections for positive action. Hubs support members to build life-long friendships to take their work to the next level.\\n8.3 Convene at least once per month – physically or virtually – to align on the hub’s purpose, projects, goals and activities. Hub meetings are collaborative and interactive.\\n8.4 Lead their own recruitment and selection efforts at least once a year to reach a minimum of 20 members. These efforts must uphold our Membership Criteria in Section 5 of this Charter.\\n8.5 Implement at least one impact project per year that is shared on TopLink. Projects benefit local stakeholders and have concrete outcomes. Projects deliver positive social change on a local issue that hub members collectively agree upon – for example, responding to a disaster, fighting climate change, accelerating reskilling or building more inclusive societies.\\n8.6 Have in place local guidelines that share the membership expectations of each Global Shaper and the hub’s process for cancelling memberships when expectations are not met.\\n8.7 Ensure that all members feel like they belong and can be themselves. If members do not practice Responsible Behaviour as per Section 6 of this Charter, hubs act immediately.\\n8.8 Are a valuable part of the global network. Hubs can opt-in or opt-out of global initiatives, collaborations or campaigns led by Global Shapers Headquarters.\\n8.9 Remain impartial and independent and therefore cannot be formed or operate on any political, ideological, cultural, racial, religious, thematic, partisan or other interests.\\nIf hubs do not uphold the above principles, Global Shapers Headquarters or the Head of the Community may pursue hub closure to uphold the standards outlined in this Charter.\\nHub Partnerships\\nFinancial and in-kind partnerships are important accelerators for positive impact. Note:\\n9.1 Hubs should follow their local regulations related to charitable work and donations. Hubs can be registered as non-profit organizations or secure fiscal sponsors to receive grants.\\n9.2 Partnerships should not be undertaken with organizations or individuals that pose a conflict of interest or reputational risk to the Global Shapers Community.\\n9.3 Hubs cannot pursue commercial interests. All monetary donations or profits made by hubs must be invested back into hub projects, operations or activities. Members should not receive financial compensation for their affiliation with a local hub.\\n9.4 Hubs can introduce an annual membership fee to support hub projects, operations and activities. However, fees cannot be exclusionary. Fees should be waived in cases where they would prohibit engagement due to the financial circumstances of members.\\n9.5 Hubs must represent themselves accurately. Hubs do not speak on behalf of nor represent the Global Shapers Community or the World Economic Forum. Hubs have no legal association with either party and cannot enter obligations on their behalf. Hubs may not use the Global Shapers Community or World Economic Forum’s name and logo without prior written approval from the Head of the Global Shapers Community. Hubs must only use their respective logos.\\nIf hubs do not uphold the above principles, Global Shapers Headquarters may pursue hub closure to uphold its reputation and the standards set out in this Charter.\\nHub Curatorships\\nHubs are led by a Curatorship – a team of two responsible for ensuring that all hub members are united by a shared sense of purpose and work together to create change.\\nThe Curatorship includes a Curator (an elected leader responsible for hub activities for a 1-year position) and a Vice-Curator (an elected leader who works with the Curator to facilitate hub activities for a 1-year position). Each hub defines how to distribute tasks between Curators and Vice-Curators. It is the responsibility of Curators and Vice-Curators to collectively ensure hubs uphold the Hub Governance guidelines and principles in Section 8 of this Charter.\\nCurators and Vice-Curators serve a 1-year position that begins on 1 July and ends on 30 June.\\nSpecifically, a Curatorship must:\\n10.1 Understand and adhere to this Charter and ensure hub members do so too.\\n10.2 Convene members at least once per month – physically or virtually – to align on the hub’s purpose, projects, goals and activities. Hub meetings are collaborative and inspiring.\\n10.3 Engage and maintain a minimum of 20 members on TopLink. All members must uphold our Membership Criteria (Section 3) and Membership Commitments (Section 5) of this Charter.\\n10.4 Help hub members to understand why the Global Shapers Community was created and how we practice our shared values of passion, integrity, service, cooperation and commitment.\\n10.5 Create local guidelines that share the membership expectations of each Global Shaper, as well as the hub’s process for cancelling memberships when expectations are not met.\\n10.6 Work with Impact Officers to ensure hubs implement at least one impact project per year that is shared on TopLink. Projects benefit local stakeholders and have concrete outcomes.\\n10.7 Appoint additional leadership roles as determined by hub goals (for example –financial, recruitment, wellbeing, inclusion, alumni and/or other officers to advance key initiatives).\\n10.8 Take steps to ensure that all members feel like they belong. If members do not practice Responsible Behaviour as per Section 6 of this Charter, Curators and Vice-Curators take action.\\n10.9 Develop hub processes related to recruitment, selection and cancellation in accordance with this Charter. In the absence of clearly defined roles, the Curatorship is responsible for hub activities, including selecting members adhering to our Membership Criteria (Section 3), as well as cancelling members according to Membership Cancellation (Section 7) of this Charter.\\n10.10 Facilitate fair and transparent hub elections to identify a new Curator, Vice-Curator and Impact Officer, and ensure an easy leadership transition for the hub.\\n10.11 Outgoing Curators do not influence hub decision-making once their leadership role has ended. They do not interfere with hub leadership, nor mandate projects or partnerships.\\nShould the principles outlined in this Charter not be upheld, a Curatorship will be held accountable. Curators and Vice-Curators are elected leaders and held to the highest standards.\\nIf a Curatorship cannot meet these principles or uphold Responsible Behaviour as per Section 6 of this Charter, hub members should seek the support of a Community Champion or Global Shapers Headquarters by emailing globalshapers@weforum.org.\\nHubs are also supported by an Impact Officer – a nominated Global Shaper who supports and reports on projects. Impact Officers ensure projects benefit local stakeholders and have concrete outcomes. They involve all interested members in the change making process and share tangible results on TopLink and in our Annual Review, which is distributed globally.\\nHub Elections\\nHubs hold elections to appoint new Curators, Vice-Curators and Impact Officers each year. Election results are submitted by 1 March annually. The following practices apply:\\n11.1 At least 2 Global Shapers must run for the position of Curator.\\n11.2 At least 1 Global Shaper must run for the position of Vice-Curator or Impact Officer.\\n11.3 A Global Shaper may serve in a leadership role for a maximum of 2 non-consecutive terms.\\n11.4 Candidates cannot age out of the community before nor during their leadership role.\\n11.5 Candidates cannot serve in other community leadership roles.\\n11.6 Candidates understand the principles and values outlined in this Charter and present no conflict of interest – including no direct family relatives or partners included in the hub.\\n11.7 Candidates are democratically elected by a majority of hub members. Curators, Vice-Curators and Impact Officers are respected by their peers and have a track record of results.\\nGlobal Shapers Headquarters may reject election results if they do not meet these criteria. Hubs are expected to hold elections in good faith. If it is discovered that the above criteria have not been upheld, election results may be overturned, and hubs may have to hold new elections.\\nHub Disagreements\\nDisagreements are a normal part of the change making process. It is the responsibility of hubs to resolve conflicts locally. Each hub should have an impartial, and if necessary confidential, resolution mechanism in place. The best resolutions are co-designed and endorsed by a majority of hub members. When a disagreement occurs, Curators should:\\n12.1 Either hold individual meetings with disagreeing members or a collective hub meeting with all members present to enable Global Shapers to share their opinions and positions openly.\\n12.2 Once priorities are identified, brainstorm possible steps to reach agreement.\\n12.3 If a hub cannot come to a collective agreement, define possible solutions or scenarios and put it to a vote. Conduct the vote openly and transparently and listen to the majority.\\n12.4 Disagreeing members are responsible for proposing possible solutions. Members do not try to sway others; they uphold Responsible Behaviour as per Section 6 of the Charter.\\n12.5 Hubs may wish to identify an impartial mediator to find a way forward. Hubs can ask a Community Manager, Community Champion, Advisory Council member or Alumni to serve in this role. Mediators should be agreed upon by a majority of hub members and in some cases, should be a neutral third party external to the hub to help disputants come to a consensus.\\nIf long-term disagreements prevent hubs from achieving their goals, members should contact their Community Champion or Global Shapers Headquarters at globalshapers@weforum.org. In the case of protracted conflict, the Head of the Community may pursue hub closure.\\nHub Opening and Closure\\nGlobal Shapers Headquarters has the sole responsibility to open and close hubs.\\nTo open a hub – Global Shapers Headquarters selects a Founding Curator. Our Membership Criteria in Section 3 of this Charter do not apply. Founding Curators are established leaders who have strong local connections and experiences. Founding Curators serve in a 1-year role.\\nFounding Curators are responsible to:\\n13.1 Understand and adhere to this Charter and ensure hub members do so too.\\n13.2 Identify a Founding Team, including five members who fulfil our Membership Criteria. With this team, recruit additional members. After one year, hubs should surpass 20 members.\\n13.3 Convene new members at least once per month – physically or virtually – and work together with local stakeholders to establish the hub’s purpose, projects, goals and activities.\\n13.4 Inspire members to deliver at least one project per year, share results on TopLink and create change with the wider Global Shapers Community and Global Shapers Headquarters.\\n13.5 Agree on local guidelines related to hub memberships, including processes related to membership onboarding, offboarding, fees and cancellations. Inform members accordingly.\\n13.6 Build a hub that is capable of lasting change. After one year, the hub should achieve our Hub Governance standards in Section 8 of this Charter and hold elections for new hub leaders.\\nFounding Curators are considered lifetime members of the Global Shapers Community. If they are above 30 when they finish their one-year position, they maintain honorary status. If Founding Curators are under 30 when they finish their one-year position, they maintain honorary status and can choose to opt into the hub as Global Shapers until they age out.\\nIf Founding Curators stay in the hub, they are not eligible for other leadership roles. Founding Curators set hubs up for long-term success, sustainability and self-determination. As Global Shapers or honorary members, Founding Curators serve as advisors when hubs ask for support.\\nAfter their mandate ends on 1 July, Founding Curators should not vote in or influence hub decision-making, interfere with hub elections, nor mandate hub projects or hub partnerships. Hubs can remove honorary Founding Curators, who are not active hub members, from daily communication channels once their mandate has ended to create space for new leadership,\\nIf Founding Curators cannot fulfil these requirements, Global Shapers Headquarters may cancel their membership or close the hub. Hubs may be reopened by new Founding Curators.\\nTo close a hub – the following conditions apply:\\n13.7 Hubs can request closure by emailing globalshapers@weforum.org. In this case, Global Shapers Headquarters will email all members and if there is no interest to continue, the hub will be closed. Closures happen annually in April, after hub elections in March.\\n13.8 If Responsible Behaviour as per Section 6 of this Charter is not upheld jeopardizing the hub's safety or the community’s reputation, the Head of the Global Shapers Community has the sole discretion to close a hub immediately. All hub members will be notified by email. The Global Shapers Community does not tolerate harassment or abusive actions of any kind.\\n13.9 If hubs are unable to uphold the Governance, Partnerships, Leadership or Elections principles outlined in Sections 8-12 in this Charter, or if long-term disagreements in hubs persist, Global Shapers Headquarters may pursue hub closure. In this case:\\nHubs will be informed of their shortcomings and may be placed under review (minimum 2 and maximum 6 months) to apply the principles outlined in this Charter. If amendments are not made within the review period, the Head of the Global Shapers Community will close the hub.\\nCommon reasons for hub closure include failure to reach 20 hub members, failure to deliver one project per year, failure to hold fair elections, failure to represent hub activities accurately and failure to create a hub culture of Responsible Behaviour.\\nGlobal Governance\\nThe Global Shapers Community is a non-profit registered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is independent, impartial and not tied to any political, ideological, or partisan interests. It is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland.\\nGlobal Shapers Headquarters is housed at the World Economic Forum.

The Head of the Global Shapers Community reserves the right to cancel memberships or close hubs at their sole and absolute discretion, if an individual or a hub does not uphold the principles of this Charter.\\nGlobal Shapers Headquarters also oversees the selection, nomination and engagement of the Global Shapers Advisory Council and Regional Community Champions.\\n14.15 Our Advisory Council ensures Global Shapers are directly involved in our community's global governance and impact.
