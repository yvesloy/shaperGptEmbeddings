Zu diesen Digital Natives gehören meine Studierenden an der Hochschule Luzern in den Bachelor- und Masterstudiengängen und der Weiterbildung, die ich in den rechtlichen Aspekten der digitalen Welt unterrichte. Dafür habe ich ein Lehrbuch gesucht und nicht gefunden. Aus diesem Grund publiziere ich nun selbst dazu. Und klar, bei diesem Thema schreibe ich natürlich nicht ein Buch, sondern «open access» direkt im Internet. Paul Arden, Autor und früherer Creative Director bei Saatchi & Saatchi, einer international tätigen Kommunikations- und Werbeagentur, meint dazu: «Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you». Die Publikation ist ein «Work in Progress» und wird laufend aktualisiert und ergänzt. Gerne können Sie mir über den Chat unten links Anregungen und Fragen senden. Oder fragen Sie ChatGPT oder einen anderen Chatbot als Ihr Lern-Coach. Eine Rechtsberatung können wir jedoch über diese Plattform nicht anbieten. Rechtliche Hotspots der digitalen Welt kommentiere ich auch aktuell auf Twitter twitter.com/juristenfutter, LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/ueli-grueter und im Blog juristenfutter.ch. Ich freue mich, mit Ihnen und meinen Studierenden in die rechtlichen Hotspots der digitalen Welt einzutauchen.\\nUeli Grüter, LL.M., Rechtsanwalt, Dozent Hochschule Luzern\\n\\n\\nUeli Grüter in 10vor10 von SRF vom 18.07.2018 zur Rekordbusse der EU-Kommission gegen Google\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFür Rechtsauskünfte oder Rechtsfälle stehe ich Ihnen gerne in der Kanzlei Keller Schneider zur Verfügung: \\nBitte aktiviere JavaScript, um die E-Mail-Adresse zu sehen.\\n\\n\\n\\nDie Publikation digilaw.ch wurde 2018 ins Webarchiv der Schweizerischen Nationalbibliothek aufgenommen: https://bit.ly/2OYj5AU\\n\\n\\n\\nChatGPT oder ein anderer, entsprechender Chatbot als Ihr Lern-Coach.

Schauen Sie dazu die Dokumentation\\xa0«Radikal digital: über Hype und Realität der Digitalisierung» der SRF-Reihe «einstein». Überlegen Sie sich dabei, wo rechtliche Aspekte eine Rolle spielen.\\nDie «Digital World» bzw. die «Digitale Welt», wie sie hier verstanden wird, umfasst alle digitalen Lebensbereiche, insbesondere das Internet mit E-Commerce, E-Banking usw., die Robotik und das «Internet der Dinge» (Internet of the Things, IoT). Dazu werden in diesem Blog die rechtlichen Hotspots beleuchtet, die uns in der «Digital World» begegnen. Darunter verstehen wir hier denn auch das «Digital Law«. Dieses geht viel weiter als Informatikrecht und Cybercrime, wobei letzteres am Schluss des Blog natürlich auch eine Rolle spielt.\\nClick to print (Opens in new window) \\n\\n',

Effektiv haben die Partner ein Unternehmen gekauft. Während den nächsten zwei Jahren kam dieses jedoch nicht richtig zum Fliegen und weitere Unternehmen kamen nicht dazu. Da sich die Partner in dieser Zeit keinen Lohn auszahlen konnten und das Vermögen der beiden Softwareentwickler praktisch aufgebraucht war, stiegen diese aus dem Projekt aus. In der Folge forderten die Softwareentwickler von den Ökonomen für ihr zweijähriges Engagement einen Lohn. Die Ökonomen ihrerseits behaupten, die Softwareentwickler hätten illegal den Sourcecode von gemeinsam entwickelter Software kopiert und mitgenommen. Seit 5 Jahren (sic!) prozessieren die Softwareentwickler nun gegen die Ökonomen. Ein Ende ist noch nicht in Sicht … Durch eine klare rechtliche Organisation und klare Vereinbarungen hätten dieses Fiasko und Tausende von Franken Kosten verhindert werden können. Der Fall ist exemplarisch für viele Start-ups, die nicht reüssieren oder bei denen bereits zu Beginn einen Teil der Partner das Projekt verlassen (s. auch Erfahrung von Start-up-Unternehmer Alessandro Soldati in BILANZ 05/2019, rechts).\\nIn diesem Kapitel geht es denn auch darum, aufzuzeigen, wie ein digitales Projekt rechtlich organisiert werden sollte und welche Vereinbarungen die Partner untereinander treffen müssen, um ein Desaster möglichst zu verhindern.\\n02 Rechtliche Organisation in digitalen Projekten\\nClick to print (Opens in new window) \\n\\n',

Häufiger dürften Start-ups so entstehen, dass jemand ein Geschäftsidee hat und für dessen Realisierung in einem Start-up ein interdiszipliläres Team um sich schart. Diese Geschäftsidee ist Ausgangspunkt des Start-ups und damit auch der Vereinbarung unter den Partnern (nachfolgend) und dessen rechtlichen Orgsanisation (nachfolgend).\\n02 Rechtliche Organisation in
